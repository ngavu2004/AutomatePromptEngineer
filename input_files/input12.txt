Description:
Screening clients for Health-Related Social Needs (HRSN) using an evidenced based screening tool on an annual basis is
needed to better understand and act on EMPACT-SPCâ€™s clients Social Determinants of Health (SDOH). EMPACT-SPC does
not currently utilize a HRSN on a consistent basis. The purpose of this project is to increase the percentage of completed
PRAPARE screenings to at least 85% of clients seen by EMPACT-SPC between October 1, 2024, and March 31, 2025.

Overview:
Benefits:
The 85% screening rate utilizing the PRAPARE Tool will provide information on risk
factors that need to be addressed either internally or connecting the clients to external
community resources. Identifying and addressing the HRSN will improve the health and
well-being of EMPACT-SPC clients and connect them to the necessary community
resources.
