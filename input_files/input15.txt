Project Description / Purpose
Screening for health-related social needs is an important part of a patientâ€™s healthcare needs. Currently, the office does
not have any screenings or the proper procedures to identify and address these needs. Participating in this project will
let us screen patients via their parents and help identify any needs the patient or their family needs.

Overview:
Desired Outcome(s):
Our desired outcome for this project is to increase the percentage of patients being
screened and provide patients & parents with the resources needed.
Benefits:
By increasing the percentage of patients being screened, not only will the patient and
their families benefit, but also the provider will be able to provide additional assistance
which will also benefit their medical needs. The patient will then have the option to
take advantage of the resources available that they may not even be aware are
available and be more willing to speak up if additional assistance is needed.
