Description:
Project Name: Implementing a new referral process
Clinic: Kids and Family Kare
Process: The provider will request referrals for a patient and send the task to a medical assistant.
The Medical assistant will then look for a specialist near the patientâ€™s home that accepts
patient insurance. Once the referral is made and faxed to the specialist office, the patient
will receive a call from the medical assistant to share this information. In a week, the
medical assistant will contact the patient again and make sure the appointment has been
made with a specialist.
TIP 2.0 Process Milestone: Referrals
Project Description / Purpose
This new referral process will help us create better communication between the patients and ensure they are receiving
proper care.

Overview:
Problem Summary:
With our current referral process, after the referral is made, we do not reach out to
confirm an appointment has been made with the specialist, therefore, many patients do
not continue with their plan of care.
Desired Outcome(s):
Have better communication between patients and their specialists.
Benefits:
Patients will continue their plan of care and communication between primary care and
specialists will become better.
