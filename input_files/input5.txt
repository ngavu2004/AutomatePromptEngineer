Overview:
Problem Summary:
Problem or Performance Gap
The Phoenix Dream Center clinic, part of the Williams Family Medical
Initiative, is currently facing a significant performance gap in terms of
patient engagement, recalcitrant treatment options, and satisfaction and
billing issues related to behavioral health. Many residents feel
disconnected from the clinic, leading to low utilization of healthcare
services and trust issues. The dream center is also unable to perform
behavioral health services, finally turning this over to Williams Family
Medicine. This disengagement is often due to a lack of trust, perceived
cultural insensitivity, and a historical lack of community involvement in
healthcare decisions within the patient population. Consequently, there are
noticeable disparities in health outcomes among the community, often
linked to unaddressed social determinants of health such as housing
instability, food insecurity, and limited access to healthcare education; lack of staff and inadequate/ineffective billing also causes a financial
strain on the phoenix dream centers 300 residents.
Impact on Staff
Increased Burnout: Clinic staff experience high levels of frustration and
burnout due to inefficiencies and the inability to meet the diverse
needs of patients effectively.
Strained Relationships: The lack of a structured feedback mechanism
means that staff are often unaware of patient concerns until they
escalate, leading to strained staff-patient relationships.
Operational Inefficiencies: Staff spend considerable time managing
avoidable issues that arise from poor patient engagement and
unaddressed social needs, detracting from direct patient care activities.
Under paid staff
Impact on Patients
Low Trust and Engagement: Patients feel underserved and neglected,
exacerbating distrust in the healthcare system. This results in lower
clinic attendance and poorer health outcomes.
Health Disparities: The lack of tailored healthcare services and
insufficient attention to social determinants of health contribute to
significant disparities in health outcomes within the community.
Underutilization of Services: Due to the negative perception and lack of
trust, many residents underutilize the available healthcare services,
which can lead to worsening health conditions and preventable hospital
visits.
Leaving the Dream center and turning back to addiction
By addressing these issues through the establishment of a Community
Advisory Board and integrating community feedback into clinic
operations, Williams Family Medicine and the Phoenix Dream Center
clinic aims to bridge these gaps, improving both staff satisfaction and
patient health outcomes and successfully billing for behavioral health
services.
Desired Outcome(s):
Desired Outcomes of the Project

Project Scope:
In Scope Project Objectives
The project aims to establish a Community Advisory Board at the Dream Center/ Williams Family
Medicine clinic to actively engage residents in healthcare decisions. This includes conducting monthly
meetings, implementing structured feedback mechanisms like surveys and focus groups, and enhancing
health equity by addressing social determinants of health. Additionally, the project seeks to streamline
communication channels to ensure transparent and continuous dialogue between the clinic and the
community, and to monitor and evaluate the impact of these initiatives regularly. We aim to measure our
effectiveness at taking over physical and medical mental health of the dream centers patients.
Out of Scope Project Objectives or Activities
This project will not include the overhaul of the entire clinic’s IT infrastructure, major renovations of
physical facilities, but may result in te development of new medical and mental health treatment
protocols to fit billing. Additionally, it will not address external healthcare policies or insurance reform but
may assist in guiding it. This project will not involve activities beyond the immediate scope of community
engagement and feedback integration specific to the Dream Center residents.
