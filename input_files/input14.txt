Project Name: Equity in Health: Bridging Gaps for a Healthier Community
Clinic: All Denova Clinics
Process: Utilizing the information gathered from the SDOH screeners to identify inequities
TIP 2.0 Process Milestone: Milestone 3
Project Description / Purpose
The project involves utilizing Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) data.

Overview:
Problem Summary:
Currently, we are collecting the SDOH data, but we are limited in analyzing that
information to identify health inequities and health-related social needs. The
information is captured in our electronic medical record, but it is not easily extrapolated
into meaningful information.
Desired Outcome(s):
The desired outcomes of this project are:
- Utilize our existing ODBC connection to build Tableau reports to aggregate
demographic, clinical, and SDOH scoring data. This report will serve as a bridge
as we move from our existing EHR to an upgraded system with more robust
population health reporting.
- Design a seamless reporting system to minimize trends to data points while
implementing a new EMR system. Anticipated implementation will be Q4
2024/Q1 2025.
- Data analysis will guide needed interventions. Anticipated area of focus to be
on transportation to and from medical and behavioral health treatment.
Benefits:
As an integrated ambulatory practice, we recognize that screening for health-related
social needs offers substantial benefits that enhance patient care and outcomes. By
identifying and addressing factors such as housing instability, food insecurity,
transportation challenges, and social isolation within the outpatient setting, healthcare
providers can offer a more comprehensive and patient-centered approach. This
integration allows for immediate referrals to social services and community resources,

ensuring that patients receive the necessary support to manage their health conditions
effectively. Consequently, this proactive strategy can prevent complications, reduce
emergency room visits, and decrease hospital readmissions, ultimately leading to better
health outcomes and lower healthcare costs.
Moreover, incorporating social needs screening into the routine workflow of an
integrated ambulatory practice fosters stronger patient-provider relationships. When
patients see that their healthcare team cares about their overall well-being, including
their social circumstances, they are more likely to trust and engage with their providers.
This trust is crucial for effective chronic disease management and adherence to
treatment plans. Additionally, by addressing social determinants of health, the practice
can help mitigate health disparities, promoting greater health equity among its patient
population. This holistic approach not only improves individual patient experiences but
also strengthens the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the healthcare system.
