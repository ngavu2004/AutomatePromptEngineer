Description:
Project Name: Improving Appointment Completion Rates for Publicly Insured Patients
Clinic: Main Street Healthcare Center
Process: Clinic scheduling
TIP 2.0 Process Milestone: Health Equity
Project Description / Purpose
Patients with public insurance often face barriers to accessing healthcare services, leading to higher rates of missed
appointments. This project aims to identify and address these barriers, ensuring that all patients have equitable access
to primary care services. The purpose of this project is to increase the percentage of completed primary care
appointments among individuals with public insurance, thereby improving access to healthcare and promoting health
equity within the patient population.

Overview:

Problem Summary:
Main Street Healthcare has observed a significant performance gap in the completion of
primary care appointments among patients with public insurance. Despite efforts to
provide high-quality care, Main Street has a high no-show rate and low appointment
adherence among this patient group. The current completion rate for primary care
appointments among patients with public insurance is 60%, compared to an 85%
completion rate among privately insured patients. This 25% performance gap indicates
that patients with public insurance are missing crucial primary care visits, which affects
their overall health outcomes and the facility's ability to deliver equitable care.
The impact on patients includes unmanaged chronic conditions, delayed diagnosis of
new health issues, and inadequate preventive care. Healthcare providers face increased
workloads and stress as they attempt to accommodate rescheduled appointments and
manage the health complications arising from missed visits. The high no-show rate
disrupts clinic operations, leading to inefficiencies, wasted resources, and scheduling
difficulties, impacting the overall workflow and morale of the staff.

Desired Outcome(s):
Key Deliverables
1. Barrier Analysis Report: Detailed analysis of the barriers faced by publicly
insured patients in completing appointments.
2. Intervention Plan: Comprehensive plan outlining the targeted interventions to
address identified barriers.
3. Educational Materials: Culturally and linguistically appropriate educational
resources for patients.
4. Training Programs: Training sessions for staff on the importance of health
equity and strategies to improve appointment adherence.
5. Progress Reports: Regular updates on the progress of the project, including key
metrics and feedback from patients and staff.
Project Goal
Increase the percentage of completed primary care appointments among individuals
with public insurance by 20% within three months.

Benefits:
Improving completed primary care appointments among patients with public insurance
enhances health outcomes through early detection and preventive care, reduces
healthcare costs by lowering emergency visits and hospitalizations, and improves patient
engagement and satisfaction by fostering trust and continuity of care. It promotes health
equity by addressing disparities and ensuring equal access to services, empowers
vulnerable populations, and optimizes resource utilization by reducing no-show rates
and improving clinic workflow. Additionally, it strengthens community health through
better population health management and public health initiatives, creating a more
efficient and equitable healthcare system.
