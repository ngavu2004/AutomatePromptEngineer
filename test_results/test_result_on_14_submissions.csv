The desired outcomes and benefits are also straightforward and do not demonstrate the same level of thoughtfulness and planning as the highest-rated submission.

The problem summary effectively highlights a critical issue related to antipsychotic prescribing, and the desired outcomes are clear and actionable. However, the benefits section could be more robust, elaborating on how addressing these risk factors will lead to specific positive impacts for patients and communities.
